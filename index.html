<p>git add <filename> git add * git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot; git push origin master</p>

<p>Change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.</p>

<p>If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with git remote add origin <server></p>

<p>to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute  git pull</p>

<p> update &amp; merge</p>

<p>to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute </p>

<p>git pull</p>

<p>in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.</p>

<p>to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use</p>

<p>git merge <branch></p>

<p>in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes. Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in conflicts. You are responsible to merge those conflicts manually by editing the files shown by git. After changing, you need to mark them as merged with</p>

<p>git add <filename></p>

<p>before merging changes, you can also preview them by using</p>

<p>git diff <source_branch> <target_branch></p>
